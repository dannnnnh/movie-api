#Movie API

This is a simple Node.js server that serves HTML files to clients based on the requested URL. The server listens for incoming requests on port 8080 and responds with either "index.html" or "documentation.html", depending on whether the URL contains the word "documentation". The server also logs all requests to a "log.txt" file in the same directory.

This project is intended as a starting point for building a movie API. You can modify the server code to implement additional functionality, such as serving JSON data or connecting to a database.
